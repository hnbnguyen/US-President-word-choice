# US-Pesident-word-choice
Analyze word choice in US presidential candidate speeches, based on winning and losing outcome

## Motivation
This is a follow-up exploration based on a project under CISC 251. This project aims to understand the pattern behind winning and losing candidates' word choices in their public speech. This is the first project where I got to work on political application in data analytics. This is something that I personally take a lot of interest in and I want to keep growing the project, fine tune existing models, experiment with more clustering methods, and polish the conclusions of the project.

## Data Cleaning
The project provide us with 5 data files in total.
For 1000 commonly used words task, we have:
1) 1000 words frequency matrix in 430 speeches
2) Speeeches' speaker and timestamp vector
3) winning/ losing outcome
For Deceptive words task, we have:
1) 78 Deceptive words matrix and their counts in 430 speeches
2) winning/ losing outcome
